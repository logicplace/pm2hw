msgstr "# <str name=help.topic.welcome.title/>\n"
"pm2hw is a tool to interface with hardware related to the"
" [Pokémon mini](https://www.pokemon-mini.net/).\n\n"
"It provides both a [GUI](gui) and a [CLI](reference) in addition to"
" acting as a Python library for interacting with PM ROMs and flash"
" cards.\n\n"
"If you are completely new to ROMs or flash carts, check out the"
" [Overview](basics) section next. Otherwise jump to whichever topic"
" you want help with."

msgid "help.topic.basics.title"
msgstr "Overview"

msgid "help.topic.basics.content"
msgstr "# <str name=help.topic.basics.title/>\n"
"In this section you will learn about what hardware is available for"
" the Pokémon mini, how they're used, and how to use this software"
" to interact with them, if possible.\n\n"
"## ROMs and other files\n"
"A ROM, short for Read Only Memory, is a copy of the contents of an"
" official game cartridge. The game cartridges use a ROM chip inside"
" in order to store the game code and resources (but not the save data,"
" it's read-only!) which gives them the name. However, when we use this"
" term, we're not talking about the chip but rather the copy of those"
" contents. It may also refer to unofficial software as well, so long"
" as it's able to run on the console if provided to said console.\n\n"
"ROM files for the Pokémon mini use the extension `.min` and save files"
" use the extension `.eep`. The PokeMini emulator also has `.minc`"
" files which provide color information, but they're not useful for"
" pm2hw, or the Pokémon mini hardware in general.\n\n"
"`.min` files are 512 KiB and `.eep` files are 8 KiB (containing 6"
" save slots).\n\n"
"## Linkers\n"
"Linkers (aka flashers, programmers, or proggers) sit in the middle"
" between your computer and your flash cart. While some systems may"
" not require linkers, all released flash carts for the PM do.\n\n"
"## Flash carts\n"
"Flash cartridges (aka flash cards) are devices which replicate the"
" functionality of an official game cartridge, at least from the"
" perspective of the console it runs on. In order to transfer a game,"
" to the cart we usually use what's called a linker. All of the PM's"
" flash carts have a specific linker which only works with that flash"
" cart.\n\n"
"The only carts mentioned here are ones people could actually buy.\n\n"
"The contents of this section is largely based on"
" [this document](https://www.pokemon-mini.net/flash-carts/).\n\n"
"### DITTO mini (rev 3.0)\n"
"DITTO mini is currently the only flash cart still in production."
" Buy it from [here](http://dittomini.com/). You can write to and"
" read from it with the DITTO mini Flasher, purchasable at the same"
" link.\n\n"
"There is a 3D-printable case available"
" [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3592237). A label for"
" which is shipped with the flash cart.\n\n"
"#### Features and information\n"
"* Designed by zoranc, developed by Plamen.\n"
"* Sold for $90 (USD) as a set (cart/linker) or $50 for just the cart"
" or linker.\n"
"* 2 MiB storage, capable of storing 3 official games with some space"
" left over.\n"
"* Fits in an official case with no modification.\n"
"* Software can write to the card from within the PM, allowing backup"
" and restoration of save files as well as dumping the BIOS.\n"
"* Official flashing tool is Ditto Flash.\n"
"* Must be used in a case, board will not make contact loose.\n\n"
"#### Support in pm2hw\n"
"Status: OK\n\n"
"Supports basic operations (read, write, erase), but is currently slower"
" than it should be.\n\n"
"#### Technical specifications\n"
"* Size: 2 MiB\n"
"* Theoretical flashing speeds: 30s (512 KiB), 2m (2 MiB)\n"
"* Flash memory: [SST39VF1681](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/25040a.pdf)\n"
"* Bridge chip: [XC9572XL-10VQ64C](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds057.pdf)\n"
"* Linker: DITTO mini Flasher\n"
"  * Connector: USB 2.0 Micro-B\n"
"  * Chip: [FT2232D](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232D.pdf)\n\n"
"### PokeCard512 (rev 2.1)\n"
"Fan made sticker by palkone available [here](https://www.pokemon-mini.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1025).\n\n"
"#### Features and information\n"
"* Designed by Lupin.\n"
"* Sold for €35 for just the cart and €55 for the linker.\n"
"* 512 KiB storage, capable of storing 1 official game.\n"
"* Fits in an official case with some modification.\n"
"  * Requires a hole in the top for the connector and a cutout in the"
" back for the flash memory chip.\n"
"* Software can write to the card from within the PM, allowing backup"
" and restoration of save files as well as dumping the BIOS.\n"
"* Official flashing tool is PokeFlash.\n\n"
"#### Support in pm2hw\n"
"Status: Good\n\n"
"Supports basic operations (read, write, erase).\n\n"
"#### Technical specifications\n"
"* Size: 512 KiB\n"
"* Flash memory: [SST39VF040](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20005023B.pdf)\n"
"* Bridge: [XC9572XL-10VQ64C](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds057.pdf)\n"

"  * Chip: [FT2232HL](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232H.pdf)\n\n"
"#### Differences from rev 2\n"
"* The CPLD (bridge chip) is rotated with a different pin layout for PCB"
" routing reasons.\n"
"* Card layout has a mounting position for both the old/long flash and"
" new/short flash package.\n"
"* The programming connector now protrudes from the card.\n"
"* Debug pins on the back of the card for easier manufacturing /"
" programming of CPLD.\n"
"* Slightly reduced component count on flasher cable, some layout"
" optimizations (e.g. all small components are on the bottom now,"
" only the USB connector and IC are on the top).\n\n"
"### PokeCard512 (rev 2)\n"
"Despite both being considered rev 2, there were two versions of this"
" card. The differentiator is the code flashed onto the CPLD, which"
" was updated on carts created after 2011-04-17.\n\n"
"The CPLD of the early versions can be updated by following the steps"
" [here](http://mrblinky.net/pm/togepi/pokecard/index.htm). This will"
" allow running software to write to the card, in order to back up"
" the save data or dump the BIOS.\n\n"
"#### Features and information\n"
"* Designed by Lupin.\n"
"* 512 KiB storage, capable of storing 1 official game.\n"

" and restoration of save files as well as dumping the BIOS.\n"
"  * Only for versions created after 2011-04-17 or early ones with"
" an updated CPLD.\n"
"* Official flashing tool is PokeFlash.\n\n"
"#### Support in pm2hw\n"
"Status: untested\n"
"The code for revision 2.1 was taken from the PokeFlash source, so"
" the code for interfacing with 2 should exist, but it may not be"
" detected properly.\n\n"

"## Pokémon Channel\n"
"Pokémon Channel was a GameCube game released worldwide which"
" contained a built-in Pokémon mini emulator. The emulation"
" quality is not great, but it's enough to play the official"
" games and some homebrew. Through the use of an injector, one"
" can play arbitrary PM ROMs on GameCube through the Pokémon"
" Channel emulator.\n\n"
"### Features and information\n"
"* Divide by 0 exception handling not seen in hardware.\n"
"* TODO: broken features in the emulator.\n"
"* No infrared support obviously!\n\n"
"### Support in pm2hw\n"
"Status: no support\n\n"
"## Multicarts\n"
"Multicarts are a way of compiling multiple games into a single"
" ROM along with a menu to select which game you want to play."
" Generally, official games will need to be patched in order to"
" run properly from a multicart.\n\n"
