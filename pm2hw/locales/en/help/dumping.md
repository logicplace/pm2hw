From the GUI, select the linker you want to dump from from the linker list. Then in the info pane, click <kbd>	<str name=info.button.dump/>	</kbd> and select the destination folder and filename. After doing so, the game will automatically be added to your game library so that you can easily flash it back onto a flash cart later.

From the CLI, run the following command:

```sh
pm2hw dump FILENAME
```

For more information on the CLI usage, see [here](reference).
