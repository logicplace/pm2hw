# <str name=help.topic.flashing.title/>

From the GUI, there are two ways to flash a ROM to your flash cart. You may select the linker and click <kbd>	<str name=info.button.flash/>	</kbd> in order to select an arbitrary ROM file to flash or you can select a game from your game library and click the button there.

From the CLI, run the following command:

```sh
pm2hw flash FILENAME
```

For more information on the CLI usage, see [here](reference).
