# <str name=help.topic.game.title/>

From here you can view information about the game and its releases (if any) as well as flash it to any connected linkers with one click. The interface looks something like this:

<widget name=gui-game/>

1. Game name
2. Game banner
3. Flash this to a connected linker
4. Details about the game and releases etc

You may flash to multiple linkers at once without waiting from this screen.
